## Overview
Built a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch to classify food reviews as positive or negative. Implemented preprocessing, tokenization, probability calculation, and prediction logic without using pre-built libraries for the core algorithm.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains 21 food reviews 
- Each review is labeled as **positive** or **negative**

## Features / Skills
- Python programming
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning)
- Probability & statistics (Naive Bayes)
- Machine Learning fundamentals
- Dataset handling (CSV / JSON)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Naive-Bayes-Classifying-Food-Reviews.git
